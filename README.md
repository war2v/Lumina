# Lumina
# Illuminate your presentations. Empower your audience.
Lumina is a smart companion app for live presentations, sermons, and talks — where presenters can effortlessly share resources in real time, and audience members can take private, personal notes during or after the session.

Designed for clarity, ease, and connection, Lumina ensures your audience stays engaged, organized, and inspired — without ever needing to ask, “Can you send me the slides?”
